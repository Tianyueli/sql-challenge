# sql-challenge Overview

The Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company)researched company workers employed during the 1980s and 1990s. The employee database consists of six CSV files, detailing employee and department information during the above period.
    For this project, i designed tables to hold the employee data, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then analyzzed the employee data attributes and their corresponding relations with each other.
In a nutshell, data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis were performed in this project.

    * Similarly, in order to access department information for an employee, the department tables have to be joined where applicable to bring light to the granular deparment number or name.
